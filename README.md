# GCE-Downloader
A software to batch download papers from GCEGguide.com
written in Python 3.4
This is a student project, im only a python beginner, the code sucks, i know
but im trying to improve

for now the program uses preset of what paper does a subject contain to determine what to download
for the 2.00 version, i would like to make it automatically grab whats on the website and make it available for download

The gui used tkinter library, but i think it is quite weak for what i want to implement
im considering to code the next version in h5 so that the browser can handle the download and multi-platform would be less of a pain
